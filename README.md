# The Clicky Game

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app can be found at: https://2Endeavor.github.io/clickygame

The player in this game receives a point the first time a card is clicked on. If the player clicks on the same image more than once, the game is over.
Each time the player clicks on a card, all the cards are reshuffled and displayed in a different order. Each successful click results in a reshuffling of the cards and an increase in score.

The images appearing on the cards were found on the internet. In order to reduce the length of the image addresses the site Bitly was used. As shown in the following example, Bitly significantly reduced the length of the image address:


## Bitly Example (https://bitly.com/)
Used https://bitly.com/ to shorten the address length of the images
for example, 
"https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&id=0BCCDDA7FB20BEFF1F1A12893515DAFE1282B44D&thid=OIP.YFMC0808PGhZS4vi4rUGVAHaFj&mediaurl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic4.businessinsider.com%2Fimage%2F59a9bcde24884960325b76f0-1003%2Fobi-wan-kenobi.jpg&exph=752&expw=1003&q=Obi-Wan+Kenobi+Character&selectedindex=9&ajaxhist=0&vt=0&eim=1,2,6
